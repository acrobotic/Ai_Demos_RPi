This is sample code is base python2.7; 

You will get some syntax and other errors if you use the pythone3;

examples:
python 2: print is the keyword.
python 3: print is the function; 

Please change some code for python3;
such as:

print s_per_s, " sec per step"
=>
print (s_per_s)
print(" sec per step")

we will update the sample code base on python 3 soon.
